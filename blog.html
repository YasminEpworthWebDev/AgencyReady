            <p>The constructive criticism I received from my tutor entailed the use of aligning text content to the centre of my page. By aligning text to the centre of the page, it creates unnecessary whitespace surrounding the large amounts of text. This makes the layout on the page look messy because of the amount of unused whitespace used throughout the layout of my website. I have changed this so the only centre aligning text is focused on headings instead of large amounts of text.</p>

            <img src="img2.jpg" height="200" width="230" alt="An example of not using whitespace within large pieves of content.">
            <p>The other constructive criticism I received from students within my class focuses’ on the design of my webpages. Each of my webpages displayed the same ‘banner’ which at the time I thought worked as I wanted my webpages to be consistent. However, students advised me to use the exact same banner for each webpage as it’s only mainly used for the home page. I took this criticism and adapted it to my new and improved webpages. I do agree that the use of the same ‘banner’ for each of the webpages can look unprofessional. Another constructive criticism discussed by my fellow students entails the different font sizes and font families displayed on my ‘footer’. For a bizarre reason, the font sizes and families on my footer were different depending on the webpage. This was a mistake made by myself and I hadn’t realised I made those mistakes until I uploaded my first submission to my unit named Agency Ready. Once I was made aware of the variety of fonts and font sizes displayed on my ‘footer’ section, I edited them and made sure they’re consistently the same throughout the flow of my webpages.</p>
            
            <img src="img3.jpg" height="200" width="230" alt="The use of Flexbox on my navigation bar.">
            <p>My tutor also gave me feedback that my H1 and H2 headings get lost within the background of my banner image. This was due to the fact I didn’t alter the text depending on the screen size. To fix this, I have ensured that my main headings on-top of my image are responsive and readable for the user at any screen size given. The tutor also gave me feedback on the use of whitespace between my content on the home page. To begin with, I inserted a break-line (br) between two pieces of content to space them out. But after listening to my feedback, I have ensured that my text content is fixated together and I have created more whitespace between my content and my circular image. Another constructive criticism given to me by my tutor was the unnecessary use of underlining headings. I cannot quiet remember why I decided to do this – I believe I wanted them to stand out as a heading. Now looking back at my old portfolio,  none of my headings needed underlining which is why I haven’t inputted any underlining in my new portfolio.</p>

        <h3>Flexbox Deliverable</h3>
            <h4>Aim and Objectives</h4>
            <p>My aim is to amend my old portfolio website so images/text can be distributed on a professional website development level. My objectives are to demonstrate my skills have developed since my first portfolio hand in by using flexbox to distribute content better and to produce a better responsive website which uses Flexbox to alter content and media depending on the screen size.</p>

            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>The technology I will be demonstrating is Flexbox. Flexbox is a layout method which makes it easier to move content, navigation bars, media etc in specific places without it taking a long time to do so.  Flexbox was proposed as an idea in 2008 by a CSS Working Group and from then a Flexbox working draft was published in 2009. From 2011 and onwards the Flexbox syntax is published and becomes a W3C Candidate Recommendation. I have used Flexbox at a low level as I didn’t understand the basics of Flexbox as I jumped into the deep end without understanding the basics. Through the videos and tasks published on Lynda.com, I have learnt the fundamental basics of Flexbox which have improved my skills using Flexbox as a whole. Lynda.com has provided a more in-depth knowledge with full explanations whilst using Flexbox which is why I think I’ve enjoyed and learnt so much from using Lynda.com.</p>
            
            <h4>Set Up</h4>
            <p>Throughout the development of my old portfolio website, I have made changes to sections of my website that can be improved by using Flexbox. For example, I have changed my navigation bar by changing the style and layout of it depending on screen sizes which has been recommended by Lynda.com. The teacher of the video I watched is named Morten Rand-Hendrisken and the course was named Advanced Responsive Layouts with CSS Flexbox. During the course,  he explains why you should display certain layouts depending on the screen size which was very helpful as it gives context behind what he is explaining.</p>

            <h4>How</h4>
            <p>The two main key points I will be discussing and which I have embedded into my new portfolio are the editing of my navigation bar and a card based layout. To begin with, I started to play around with different layouts for my potentially new navigation bar. In my previous portfolio, you can see that my navigation bar is clearly non-existent as it’s just words on top of an image. I wanted to create a professional navigation bar compared to my old portfolio. Through the work of Flexbox, I have now created a navigation bar with social media icons. Whilst watching the Lynda.com videos, Morten described the different layouts of a navigation bar depending on the screen size. He explained that for a mobile friendly navigation bar, it is widely known to use a column based ‘flex-direction’ as it ensures that all the content displayed in the navigation is visible. At first, my navigation bar was displaying a row direction which I changed after listening to Morten. I decided to use a single-level menu layout which alters depending on the screen size. For anything over 768px, I changed the navigation bar to display a ‘row’ direction as the screen is big enough to fit the full navigation on the screen.</p>
            <img src="img5.jpg" height="200" width="250" alt="An image of my navigation bar set as a column direction.">

            <p>I also added social media icons within my navigation bar instead of the bottom of my webpage (which I previously did) as I wanted the user to find it easier to access my social media accounts. I created a transparent background for my navigation bar so the background image was visible. The orange border around the navigation bar is the same colour orange as the background image as I wanted to keep the colours throughout the website consistent with my background image.</p>

            <p>The other key point I will be discussing is a card layout. A card layout within Flexbox allows a webpage to be organised in ‘cards’ so it’s easier to categorise content. Through the Lynda.com videos, I have adapted the card layout shown on the videos to my own portfolio. In my previous portfolio my blog posts, CV and my work page were simply just placed within HTML and CSS within the use of a card layout. To ensure my card layout displays like a card layout, I have ensured that the background colour is lighter than the background of my whole website so it’s easier to differentiated. I have also ensured that my content has suitable headings, text-aligns and font sizes depending on the screen size.</p>
            <img src="img8.jpg" height="270" width="230" alt="An image of my card layout on my 'Work' page.">

            <h4>Evaluation</h4>
            <p>I believe that I have demonstrated my deliverable at a high performance standard. I have fixed and upgraded my navigation bar which changes at different screen sizes to fit the needs of the user. By learning and understanding the reasons behind why certain navigations are set out in a row or column has put context into my navigation bar learning. My layouts of large amount of text has helped enormously by the card layout. The one thing I could’ve improved more on is the layouts of my cards. I would’ve liked to have my cards placed next to each other instead of one below the other as I think it would’ve suited the layout more. However, with the amount of text displayed on each of the blog posts I believe it would’ve looked messy and unorganised. Overall, I have improved my knowledge about responsive layouts by using Flexbox to attract potential employers for the unseen future of my career within the front end website development field.</p>

        <h3>Sass Deliverable</h3>
        <h4>Aim and Objectives</h4>
        <p>The aim of my Sass deliverable is to use Sass to improve the performance of my website as I’m going to transfer my CSS pages into one Sass page which will aid me to making quick changes within my website. My objectives include compiling my four CSS pages into one Sass page to improve the speed and agility of my website as a whole. I also want to use Sass to change content/colours/font size etc easily compared to going onto every CSS page and editing it that way. I want to demonstrate the use of nesting so a large Sass page with lots of code can still be readable and organised for users to access.</p>

        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>The technology I will be demonstrating is Sass. Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets and is a stylesheet pre-processor. Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and was developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006. Sass is compiled with CSS and can be done via application or a command line. To write Sass code, you can use two syntaxes which are named SCSS and is the newer version or Sass which is the older version. This is my first time using Sass within my CSS. I am a confident CSS coder so using Sass within my portfolio was easier than I anticipated. I have used Sass within my portfolio as I needed to compress four CSS stylesheets into one to begin with and then use Sass to create variables to manage the displays of my portfolio. Throughout my journey of learning Sass, I have used Lynda.com to aid my learning and I have completed a Sass Essential Training course produced by Ray Villalobos. The course describes the understanding of Sass and working with the main key points within my Sass deliverable which are variables and nesting.</p>
        
        <h4>Set Up</h4>
        <p>I have made the appropriate changes to my old portfolio by using Sass to help me. To begin with, I downloaded a live sass compiler from the Visual Code marketplace which pre-processors the Scss code you’re writing into a CSS. By clicking on the ‘Watch Sass’, it automatically writes your code into CSS which saves you a lot of time! This is a very helpful tool as it has saved me a lot of time when coding in Sass. Once I had got used to the live sass compiler, I began to use variable and nesting techniques to ensure the easiness of changing colours/texts/fonts etc at a fast rate and by organising my code using nesting.</p>

        <h4>How</h4>
        <p>The first key point I will be discussing within my Sass deliverable is the use of variables within my code. I have created colour, font family and font size variables within Sass to ensure the easiness and efficiency of writing my code. Instead of retyping the same colour, font size or font family constantly, variables allow you to type the name of the variable you have set an orange colour to. For example, the variables I have created for certain colours within my website include; $maincolour: #001541, $seondarycolour: #0C1A47 and $cardbackground: #0e2158. These variables display the variations of shades of dark blue used within my code. Instead of retyping the tedious colours into different sections of my website, I can simply and easily type the variable I have created.</p>
        <img src="img10.jpg" height="200" width="230" alt="A print screen of my variables witin my Sass code.">

        <p>Hypothetically, if I decided to change my website to neon pink, I could do this easily by changing the colour of the variable. This saves me a lot of time as I don’t have to go into every section of my code and implement it manually. As I was rewriting my code to suit Sass, I realised how many font sizes and font families were consistently the same which is why I created variables to reduce the amount of code I was writing. Within Ray Villalobos videos, he discusses how to work with variables within a suitable way which is how I’ve adapted them to my own code.</p>
        <img src="img11.jpg" height="200" width="230" alt="An image of my code which has been nested.">

        <p>The second key point I will be discussing regarding my process of learning Sass is nesting. Nesting is a used within Sass to ensure that organisation and short cuts are present within the code. We all know that coding can become quite messy and unorganised at times. But by the use of nesting, it allows you to write code within the same bracket of coding. This rule is not allowed in CSS which is why it’s a great tool developed by Sass. It creates less code to write as you’re under the same umbrella of a div or section etc. Creating less amount of typing is a huge sigh of relief for coders like myself who find it repetitive and boring at times when having to repeat lots of amounts of code. Ray Villalobos discusses the use of nesting within your styles which has aided me to use it within my code.</p>
        <img src="img12.jpg" height="200" width="230" alt="An image of my code which has been nested.">
        
        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>Throughout the journey of learning a new pre-processed language, I believe I have exceeded my expectations of how well I have adapted to learning Sass. Sass has made me realise the short cuts within Sass which doesn’t make me hate coding as much as I used to do. Lynda.com has allowed me to watch videos and implement then into my own coding to aid my learning. As I have only touched upon two elements within Sass, I still have a lot to learn and develop as there are many more features to learn within Sass. But by having this start off with Sass, it will demonstrate to potential employers that I have touched upon Sass and I am willing to learn more about it.</p>
