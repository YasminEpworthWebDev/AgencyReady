            <h3>Work experience</h3>
            <h4>Waitressing and Bar work</h4>
        </figure>
            <p>I have worked at Koko Japanese restaurant for 3 years. I was one of the first waitress's at Koko when it first opened in 2015. Koko is a very elegant, sophisticated restaurant with customers always expecting high quality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My responsibilities included waiting on customers, taking orders, preparing drinks and serving them, taking food out to customers, cleaning tables, resetting tables, card transactions and working on the till. Over the summer, I have been working in manager roles for extra work. My responsibilities included opening up the shop, sweeping and mopping the restaurant before service, handling deliveries, taking charge of service and closing up the restaurant ready for the next day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have gained a lot of confidence whilst working as a waitress. Delivering a level of standard requires someone to be friendly, helpful and understanding. And i believe I have accomplished all of these qualities to provide excellent service. I've been in a manager role which has allowed me to understand the difficulty of always wanting to provide the best service.  In a service there will be mistakes, and i've learnt how to deal with them in a professional manor.</p>
