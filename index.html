                    <p>My name is Yasmin Epworth and I am 21 years old from Sheffield, England. 
                    I joined Manchester Metropolitan three years ago and began studying Digital Media and Communications.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Before I started my degree, I studied IT at Sheffield City College for two years which gave me 
                       a insight into the tech industry. My main career aspiration is to become a front end web developer 
                       for any major company that has a vast ratio of women to men in the tech industry. After realizing whilst 
                       in college that very few women were in the tech industry, it created a drive within myself to not give up 
                       due to diversity within the tech work place. Growing up within my household, I have always had to defend and
                       develop myself as a woman independently as I have two older brothers who have always dictated my every move. 
                       By constantly having male authority in my life, it has encouraged me to become rebellious against the norms of
                       society which I have implemented into my career aspirations.</p>
