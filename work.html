            <h3>My first website</h3>
            <p>This is the first ever professional-ish website I have ever coded. The website was apart of a 2nd year assingment. The website was based on myself and my interests. A lot of my interests surround Asian culture which is why I wanted to have a bright and bold banner as it reflects my personality.</p>

            <h3>Group Website</h3>
            <p>This website wasn’t created solemnly by myself. This website was created with my help and my team members help. This website was created in my 2nd year of University as a part of our coursework. We were instructed to create any type of website we wanted to but it had to be helpful for young adults/students who aren’t from Manchester or might be moving to Manchester for University.   We decided to go with a burger theme website which helps navigate students to the best burger in their specific area (in central Manchester.) We included a home page, about us page, restaurants page, offers page and a contact page.</p>
